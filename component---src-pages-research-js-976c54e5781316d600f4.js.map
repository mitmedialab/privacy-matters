How do you translate, measure, and test values and\n                high level aspirations into a user interface?

Finally, we sought to understand\n                broader user perspectives of privacy and control on social\n                media.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Our research was framed around three key questions:\n                <ol>\n                  <li>\n                    How do various roles use and think about privacy in their\n                    fields?\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Based on a variety of backgrounds, what are the strengths\n                    and challenges of the privacy bills and prototypes?\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    What are the perceptions of privacy and technology\n                    practitioners on proposed legislation aimed at modifying\n                    social media design?\n                  </li>\n                </ol>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Our full report contains in-depth findings and analyses around\n                these research questions, as well as recommendations and\n                insights for policymakers and industry practitioners working in\n                privacy-related spaces.\n              </p>\n            </Col>\n            <Col md={6}>\n              <CalloutCard flush title=\"Who we talked to\">\n                <p>\n                  We interviewed 41 people from different industries and\n                  backgrounds, including:\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>8 academics</li>\n                    <li>8 nonprofits + advocacy organizations</li>\n                    <li>8 industry practitioners</li>\n                    <li>6 members of the public</li>\n                    <li>5 lawyers</li>\n                    <li>3 government employees</li>\n                    <li>3 policy researchers</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </p>\n              </CalloutCard>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n        </Layout>\n        <CardSection buffer>\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-end\">\n            <Col md={5}>\n              <Card className=\"p-5\">\n                <div className=\"p-2\">\n                  <h2>\n                    <span className=\"half-highlight\">Our process</span>\n                  </h2>\n                  <p className=\"pt-2 pb-3 subheading-2\">\n                    We summarized, created visual prototypes, and collected\n                    feedback for three draft bills on online privacy and data\n                    governance.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </Card>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n        </CardSection>\n        <Layout>\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-between\">\n            <Col md={6}>\n              <CalloutCard flush title=\"Our team in action\">\n                <TeamActionImage />\n                <p>\n                  Sketching mockup ideas during a website design sprint session!\n                </p>\n              </CalloutCard>\n            </Col>\n            <Col md={6}>\n              <h2>\n                <span className=\"half-highlight\">Selecting the bills</span>\n              </h2>\n              <p className=\"\">\n                Our team reviewed the latest public draft bills on online\n                privacy and data governance from 2018 to 2020.
