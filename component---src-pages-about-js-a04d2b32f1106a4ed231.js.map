How do these policies translate in practice? How they\n            might affect us? We interviewed 41 people, including lawyers,\n            designers, engineers, civil rights advocates, policymakers, and\n            stewards of sensitive data: social workers, pediatricians,\n            librarians. These conversations revealed 1) the diverse definitions\n            and contexts of privacy 2) a variety of responses to recent data\n            governance and privacy draft bills, and 3) the biggest\n            privacy-related challenges (and possible ways to solve them) in\n            different fields.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            We believe in transparency and in improving how we translate complex\n            topics to the public. This project aims to better inform and engage\n            everyday people -- the non-privacy related lawyers, technologists,\n            researchers about some of the latest developments in policy. The\n            project also aims to bring together cross-disciplinary insights to\n            inform policymakers about how their bills can impact end users and\n            people who manage sensitive data for a variety of marginalized and\n            vulnerable communities.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This research reflects only a small portion of the diverse\n            perspectives we can bring to data governance and policy making. We\n            hope to spur more conversations, reveal new insights, and prompt\n            positive action.\n          </p>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
