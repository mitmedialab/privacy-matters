“I think the ability to delete your data is nice and I just don't think people download their data from Facebook. It feels like they're protecting themselves, being like 'you can access this data at any time' and I'm like that data doesn't mean anything to people and might not get at the meat of what data they all have or sold that might make you vulnerable. It feels just like a soft attempt to be more transparent.”
