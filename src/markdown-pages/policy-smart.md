- Bans infinite scroll, autoplay, and other addictive features on social media

  - Infinite scroll, autoplay, and “achievements” such as “Snapstreak” exploit the science of addiction to make it difficult to leave a social media platform
  - Exceptions include music playlists, social media predominantly designed to stream music, and “achievement” badges that substantially increase access to new services or functionality
  - Social media platforms would have to include natural stopping points

- Requires choice parity for consent

  - Companies would no longer be allowed to manipulate people into consenting by making it difficult to decline consent
  - Companies would have to design “accept” and “decline” boxes using the same formats, fonts, and sizes

- Gives the FTC and HHS authority to ban other similar practices

  - Rules would expire after 3 years unless ratified by Congress

- Gives users power to monitor and control their use time on social media
  - Social media companies must provide an in-app tool that enables users to track the time they spend on social media across all devices and allows users to impose caps on the amount of time they spend
