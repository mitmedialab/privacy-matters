First,\n                  operationalizing privacy policies into practice is nebulous\n                  and challenging. How do you translate, measure, and test\n                  values and high level aspirations into a user interface?\n                  Second, there is a natural silo between industries fortifying\n                  rare integration between industry, policy, and academic\n                  research.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The first objective for this work was to explore intersections\n                  of privacy policy and design through visual prototypes. The\n                  second was to understand the challenges of translating policy\n                  to platform changes based on the specific background and\n                  industry skill set of the interviewees. Finally, we sought to\n                  understand broader user perspectives of privacy and control on\n                  social media.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Our research was framed around three key questions:\n                  <ol>\n                    <li>\n                      How do various roles use and think about privacy in their\n                      fields?\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                      Based on a variety of backgrounds, what are the strengths\n                      and challenges of the privacy bills and prototypes?\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                      What are the perceptions of privacy and technology\n                      practitioners on proposed legislation aimed at modifying\n                      social media design?\n                    </li>\n                  </ol>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Our full report contains in-depth findings and analyses around\n                  these research questions, as well as recommendations and\n                  insights for policymakers and industry practitioners working\n                  in privacy-related spaces.\n                </p>\n              </Col>\n              <Col md={6}>\n                <CalloutCard flush title=\"Who we talked to\">\n                  <p>\n                    We interviewed 41 people from different industries and\n                    backgrounds, including:\n                    <ul>\n                      <li>8 academics</li>\n                      <li>8 nonprofits + advocacy organizations</li>\n                      <li>8 industry practitioners</li>\n                      <li>6 members of the public</li>\n                      <li>5 lawyers</li>\n                      <li>3 government employees</li>\n                      <li>3 policy researchers</li>\n                    </ul>\n                  </p>\n                </CalloutCard>\n              </Col>\n            </Row>\n          </Layout>\n          <CardSection buffer>\n            <Row className=\"justify-content-end\">\n              <Col md={5}>\n                <Card className=\"p-5\">\n                  <div className=\"p-2\">\n                    <h2>\n                      <span className=\"half-highlight\">Our process</span>\n                    </h2>\n                    <p className=\"pt-2 pb-3 subheading-2\">\n                      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,\n                      sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna\n                      aliqua.
